# ShinyLibrary
Examples of R Shiny Applications Built Over Past 5 Years

These examples are of varying states of completion, and of varying quality/documentation of code. But the examples within can be built on/adapted to other purposes if needed. Links to each of the applications are provided below and the code is in the relevant subfolders. Examples using API requests to obtain data from other servers have been modified in this repo so that usernames and passwords do not appear. All other examples should run on a shiny server without further modification.

# Sampling game
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/BrexitSampling/	
Simulation showing impact of different sampling methods with different sample sizes on a real example. Voting data taken from UK 2016 referendum, showing impacts of of non-random sampling methods. Can be used by presenter or link given for people to work with by themselves

# Analysis exercise
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/mm_workshop/Analysis/	
Analysis exercise using real survey data to try to understand results from surveys, and interpret them in a real world context. Tries to guide users through slightly, but also highlight the impact of survey weights and confounding variables.

# Comment analyser	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/WhyR/	
Link is shared for comments to be submitted. These then appear anonymously and can be analysed using basic word clouds and emotional analysis

# Design effect	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/DEFF/	
Attempt to illustrate the impact of design effects on survey estimates in an intuitive way

# ODK link	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/ODKLink/	
Link between Shiny and an ODK server with summaries of results immediately presented

# Rating ranking game	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/AskingBetterQuestions/	
Group split in 2, and half people given a rating task and the other half given a ranking task. Then results can be immediately analysed and discussion on process, differents and modes of analysis

# ODK Number	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/odknumber/	
Automatically generates question numbers for an ODK form

# Confidence intervals & estimation	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/EstimationExamples/	
Tool illustrating sampling error and confidence intervals from random samples

# Random sample generator	
https://shiny.stats4sd.org/randomsample/	
Tool to randomly draw samples, and replacement samples from a pre-defined sample frame
